# DEEP FAKE DETECTION
## Abstract
In recent months, free deep learning-based software tools has facilitated the creation of credible face
exchanges in images that leave few traces of manipulation, in what they are known as fake face
detection. Manipulations of digital images have been demonstrated for several decades through the
good use of visual effects.The recent advances in deep learning have led to a drastic increase in
the realism of fake content and the accessibility in which they can be created using the so-called
AI-synthesized media (popularly referred to as fake). Creating the fake images using the Artificial
intelligent tools is a simple task but, when it comes to detection of these fake images, it is a major
challenge. Hence, training the algorithm to spot the fake images is not simple. We have taken a step
forward in detecting the fake images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).Our system uses
CNN to extract the features at the frame level. These features are used to train a CNN Model which
learns and classifies if a given image has been subjected to manipulation or not.

## Problem Definition
Deep Fake involves images which are often obscene, in which a face can be swapped with the
same morphed face using neural networks and it may be very difficult to detect whether the image is a
real one or fake. Hence, Deep Fake is a general public concern, thus itâ€™s important to develop methods
to detect them.
